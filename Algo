Ordering A Pizza

1: First, ensure that you have adequate funds to be buying pizza. No one wants to have to modify an order due to insufficient funds!
2: Next,choose your favorite pizzeria.
3: Decide what you want to eat. This is the time to choose your crust style, crust flavor, sauce, and toppings. Also, decide if you want any dipping sauce. (I personally prefer ranch and sometimes the melted garlic butter!
4: Call and place your order. Be sure to order clearly and respectfully.
5: Wait for delivery.
6: Pay the delivery driver. PS: REMEMBER TO TIP!!!
7: Enjoy!
